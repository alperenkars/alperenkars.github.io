I'm Alperen, but most people just call me Alpi (like LP).  

I’m currently based in Istanbul, and a senior in computer science + economics with a minor in international relations. I like blending data, coding, and social perspectives to figure out how things work. I’m naturally curious about many areas, though lately I’ve been focusing more on AI alignment and governance.

Recently, I completed my consulting internship at [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/). Before that, I worked in product at [Togg](https://www.togg.com.tr) (Turkey’s national electric vehicle company), data science at [MagicPort](https://magicport.ai) (Singapore-based maritime tech startup), and research at [MA-CSSL](https://ma-cssl.com/home) (computational social sciences lab).

Outside of work, I run road races and climb mountains. You can see a list of the peaks I’ve summited [here]({% link personal.md %}).
