Since childhood, I’ve been pretty bad at succeeding in the things I like, and at liking the things I succeed in. In the past few years, I think I’ve hit a good balance with mountaineering, running, and occasionally climbing.

## Things I follow

I believe that spending too much time on Instagram, TikTok, or the never-ending news stream (especially if you live in Turkey) kills productivity. Instead, I follow a series of podcasts and newsletters, which I find much more helpful for keeping a clear mind and continuing to learn. I share my favorite ones here.
